# PIZZA MACHINE

Demo:

http://rogerngo.com/demo/pizzamachine/index.html

Game:
- Make a pizza for Arnold, or else be forced to go to the gym and do push ups!

You have essentially, 14 chances to make a pizza that Arnold will like. 10 chances for pizzas he just doesn't want, and 4 chances for which the pizza is missing a key ingredient.

If you exceed either 10 or 4, then you must go to the gym and do push ups with Arnold. Can you make the perfect pizza?
